The Shortcuts module

    This module provides a short URL facility for LibreCCM. A shortcut
    consists of an (internal) URL to redirect and an target URL to which
    the request is redirected. 

    One common use case is to define shortcuts for several legally required
    informations which redirect to the correct content item.
