LibreCCM

    LibreCCM is a highly advanced (Web-) Content Management System based
    on Java EE. 

    This is the next generation variant of LibreCCM. In this version which
    currently developed in parallel the current version, several custom APIs
    like the persistence layer have been replaced with standard APIs from
    Java Community process. 

    Please note that this is a project in its early phase of development. Some
    aspects may change without warning.

    The most notable change is the move the JPA as
    persistence layer. We are using Hibernate as implementation because 
    Hibernate currently provides one important feature which other JPA providers
    do not provide: Versioned or better audited entities. This extension is
    called Envers. Auditing is currently not part the JPA standard therefore
    we need to use s specific implementation.

    Another notable change is that the build system is now using
    {{{http://maven.apache.org/}Apache Maven}}. The project is a standard
    multi module project. More informations can be found at the 
    {{{./building.html}Building LibreCCM}} page.

    For testing {{{http://junit.org/}JUnit 4}} is used. For testing Java EE
    components like CDI beans the {{{http://arquillian.org/}Arquillian}} testing
    platform is used. More details about the test system can be found on the
    {{{./testing.html}Testing LibreCCM}} page. 

    Please note that this documentation is work in progress and is may 
    incomplete.
