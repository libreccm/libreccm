            <p>
                Foundry is a theme engine for the LibreCCM family of Content Management systems, for
                example ScientificCMS and APLAWS+. Some parts of based on the Mandalay theme engine 
                developed by SÃ¶ren Bernstein for ScientificCMS.

            <p>
                With Foundry the designer has full control of the HTML created from the content managed
                by CCM. The templates for defining the HTML are almost plain HTML (in XML syntax) with
                some additional elements which provide the data to display.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that Foundry requires an XSL 2 processor. The only one available in CCM
                is Saxon HE. To use Foundry you must configure CCM to use Saxon HE as XSL processor.
