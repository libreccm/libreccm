        <h1>About this manual</h1>
        <main>
            <p>
                This manual is separated into two parts. The <a href="#user-manual">first part</a> is 
                for designers and administrators (called users in the context of this manual). It
                describes the structure of the templates in Foundry, how CSS files are implemented
                and how Frameworks like <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>, 
                <a href="http://www.yaml.de">YAML</a> or <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> 
                can be integrated into a Foundry theme. The first part also contains a reference
                part which describes all elements/tags which can be used in the templates. 
                If you are viewing this documentation using an URL like 
                <code>/themes/foundry/doc/</code> this reference is created on the fly from the 
                XSL files.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <a href="#developer-manual">second part</a> is for developers which want to 
                extend Foundry. It describes the 
                structure of Foundry, how support for content types (the most common task) can be 
                added, how the documentation system works and which XPath functions and XSL helper 
                templates are available. Developers should also read the first part because the
                first part includes informations about the general structure of Foundry.
            </p>
