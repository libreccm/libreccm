/**
 * Encapsulates the selection of a single object from many
 * possibilities. The <code>SingleSelectionModel</code> allows components to
 * communicate selections without tying the component that manages the
 * selection in the user interface (for example a {@link List}) to the
 * components that consume the selection (such as an edit form that needs
 * to know which object should be edited).
 *
 * <p> Selections are identified by a key, which must identify the
 * underlying object uniquely among all objects that could possibly be
 * selected. For objects stored in a database, this is usually a suitable
 * representation of the object's primary key. The model relies on the
 * key's <code>equals</code> method to compare keys, and requires that the
 * key's <code>toString</code> method produces a representation of the key
 * that can be used in URL strings and hidden form controls.
