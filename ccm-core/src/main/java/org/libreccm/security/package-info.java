/**
 * This package contains all classes dealing with authentication and 
 * authorisation in LibreCCM.
 * 
 * Most of this classes are only relevant for the developers of the core part
 * of LibreCCM and and core administration UI. For developers of modules the
 * primary interface is the Apache Shiro Library. Module developers usually have
 * the use these classes only in the {@code CcmModule#install(InstallEvent) 
 * method to create roles and privileges for their module. Therefore most 
 * methods of these classes can only be invoked by the System user. 
 * 
 * The check if the current user is logged in and/or has a certain permission
 * you have to obtain the current {@link Subject} from Shiro. In LibreCCM the
 * subject is provided using CDI. In classes eligible for injection you simply
 * inject the current subject. In other classes you can use the {@link CdiUtil}
 * class.
 * 
 * Another option for method of CDI beans is to use the interceptors provided by 
 * this package.
 *
