/**
 * <p>
 * The {@code pagemodel} packages provides an abstraction layer between the data
 * model of page and its generating components. This layer replaces the JSP
 * templates which were used in previous versions for this purpose.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Page Model system allows it to specify which components are used on a
 * page are therefore which information is displayed on a page. It is intended
 * to be used for public pages (like the item page of a content item category
 * page in ccm-cms. The Page Model system uses data containers which are read by
 * some builder classes. Because we are not using any active code in the page
 * models this avoids a potential attack point.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The central interface is the {@link org.libreccm.pagemodel.PageBuilder}
 * interface. An implementation of this interface will take a
 * {@link org.libreccm.pagemodel.PageModel} and process it and create a page
 * from it using the view technology supported by the implementation.
 * {@code PageBuilder}s are CDI beans. Implementations can be retrieved using
 * the {@link org.libreccm.pagemodel.PageBuilderManager#findPageBuilder(String, Class)} method.
 * </p>
