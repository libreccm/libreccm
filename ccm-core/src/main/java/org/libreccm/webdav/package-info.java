/**
 * Annotations and classes for exposing resources via WebDAV using JAX-RS. 
 * The classes in these packages are based on classes originally created for 
 * JAX-RS. This project was hosted on the now defunct dev.java.net site. The
 * sources now be found at {@link https://gitlab.com/headcrashing/webdav-jaxrs}.
 * Unfortunately the project is not maintained anymore and has not been updated
 * for JAX-RS 2. Therefore we used the classes only as foundation for our 
 * implementation. The classes have been edited to match our coding standards
 * and to be compatible with new versions of JAX-RS and other libraries.
