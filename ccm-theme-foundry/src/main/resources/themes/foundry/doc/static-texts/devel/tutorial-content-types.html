        <h1>Adding support for Content types</h1>
    <main>
        <p>
            To enable Foundry to output a Content Item of specific content type two things must be
            available: One or more layout template associated with the content type and appropriate 
            template tags to display to informations of the content item from the data tree.
        </p>
        <p>
            Foundry provides a general tag <a href="#show-property"><code>show-property</code></a> 
            which can be used to output properties of a content type. For simple types this maybe 
            sufficent. The name of the property can
            be found out from the XML output which can be viewed by adding the parameter 
            <code>output=xml</code> to an URL.
        </p>
        <p>
            For more complex types or if the value of the property should be formatted in a special
            way it is maybe necessary to implement some new template tags. Tags which part of the
            official distribution of Foundry are found in the 
            <code>foundry/lib/template-tags/content-items</code> directory. Custom extensions can
            be put into the <code>user</code> directory (not supported yet).
        </p>
        <p>
            For each content type there should be a separate file named after the content type. 
            A relatively simple example is the <em>NewsItem</em> type. In this case the
            date of the news needs some formatting. The <code>news.xsl</code> file provides the tag
            <code>news-date</code> which allows the template author to choose the format of the 
            date. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A more complex example is the <em>MultiPartArticle</em> type. The type needs some
            templates for creating the menu with the sections etc. The tags for are evaluating the
            data tree and creating the menu.
        </p>
        <p>
            One important rule is that the template tags should not create any HTML. They should
            only provided the necessary informations and output the values of properties. HTML is 
            only generated by the HTML tags provided by Foundry. A template tag for a content type
            may enclose several HTML elements which are used to define the HTML output.
