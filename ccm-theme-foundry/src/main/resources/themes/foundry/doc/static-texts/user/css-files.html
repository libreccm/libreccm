        <h1>CSS files</h1>
        <main>
            <p>
                The system for loading CSS files is similar to the system for finding layout 
                templates. Which CSS files are loaded for a page is determined by the 
                <code>conf/css-files.xml</code>. The root element of this file is an 
                <code>css-files</code> element. This element has multiple <code>application</code>
                child elements. Each <code>application</code> has an mandatory attribute 
                <code>name</code> which contains the name of the application for which the CSS files 
                named in the element are loaded. To further distinguish between pages provided by the 
                same application the optional attribute <code>class</code> can be used.
                There should be also an <code>default</code> 
                element which determines the CSS files to load when no matching 
                <code>application</code> element is found.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some pages have no application name in the data tree XML. In this cases to name of 
                the application is set to <code>none</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each <code>application</code> element and the <code>default</code> element 
                in <code>css-files.xml</code> can contain multiple <code>css-file</code> element. 
                Each of the <code>css-file</code> elements defines a single XML to load.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>css-file</code> element has two optional attributes:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>media</dt>
                <dd>
                    The media type, for example <code>screen</code> or <code>print</code> for 
                    which the CSS file is used. The value of this attribute will appear in the
                    media attribute of the <code>link</code> element which is generated in the HTML
                    to load the CSS file.
                </dd>
                <dt>origin</dt>
                <dd>
                    The origin of the CSS file. If not set the file is loaded from the current 
                    theme. If set to <code>master</code> the file is loaded from the master theme 
                    if the current theme is a child theme. If set to <code>internal</code> the 
                    file is loaded from the internal directory for CSS files, either from the
                    current theme (if the current theme is a master theme) or from the Foundry
                    master theme installed at <code>/themes/foundry</code>.
                </dd>
            </dl>
        </main>
