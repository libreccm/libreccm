LibreCCM Bundle for Wildfly

    This module provides the LibreCCM development bundle for the Wildfly 
    application server. 

    This bundle is not meant for production use as its contains most of the
    available modules. 

    Developers can run this LibreCCM directly from Maven. Three profiles are
    provided:

    [h2] Uses a H2 database located in the project build directory. This means
    that the database is deleted every time <<<mvn clean>>>.
    
    [pgsql] Uses an PostgresSQL database with a generic configuration. The
      PostgreSQL server must run on localhost and the standard port and there
      must be a database called with <<<libreccm-devel>>> which is accessible 
      for the user <<<ccm>>> using the password <<<ccm47web>>>.

    [generic] Uses an existing Wildfly installation. The datasource for the 
    database which is used by LibreCCM has to be configured by the user for this
    profile. Also, Maven or more exactly the wildfly-maven-plugin has to know
    the location of the Wildfly instance to use. The location of the Wildfly 
    instance can either be provided on the command line when invoking Maven 
    or by setting the <<<JBOSS_HOME>>> environment variable.

    The <<<h2>>> and the <<<pgsql>>> profile add a user to the Wildfly server
    with the username <<<admin>>> and the password <<<admin123>>> which allow 
    the developer to access the management web UI of the Wildfly server.
